A simple Node application for a user to upload a photo to a server and view the photo on the server.
This could easily be modified to also give the user a link to the photo and run a scheduled task to delete the photo after
a period of time creating a temporary image hosting service.  The app currently only supports .png files.

NPM packages installed:

formidable
